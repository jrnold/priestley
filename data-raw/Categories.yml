        HEATHEN PHILOSOPHERS, which are further subdivided according to their sects in the following manner:
        \[Ionic, Socractic, Cyrenaic, Megaric, Eleatic, Academic, Peripatetic, Stoic,
        Cynic, Italic, Sceptic, Epicurean.\]

        *N. B.* Several of the PHILOSOPHERS who were contemporary with the CHRISTIAN FATHERS
        (many of whom were usually called Sophists) I have placed, for want of room
        in their proper division, in that of CRITICS, to whom they had a very near
        relation; a very few among the MATHEMATICIANS; if they ever distinguished themselves
        in that character, as Proclus and some others.
      note: >-
        Ancient Philsopher was used instead of Ancient Greek Philosopher since
        it includes Confucius.
