## Introduction

Joseph Priestley's *A Chart of Biography*, first published in 1764, is the, or one of the, first instances of a modern timeline. (ADD Citation)

The **priestley** package is a data-only package containing datasets used in the 
the biographic information used in the 1764 and 1778 editions of the the *Chart of Biography*.


The data timelines include approximately two thousand individuals
(`r sum(Biographies$in_1778)` in the 1764 edition and `r sum(Biographies$in_1778)` in the 1778 edition) "the most distinguished in the annals of fame".
The stated criteria for selection into this list was "fame" rather than "merit".

> My rule, I considered, was renown and not merit; acquired fame,
> and not deserved reputation : so that a person who had
> made a great noise in the world, though he were
> known by nothing but the devastation he had made
> in it, was more acceptable to me than one who had
> deserved ever so well of it, if he had passed through
> it without being much known.

The list of individuals was both Priestley's opinion and particular to an educated 
18th century Englishman. However, the purpose of reproducing the data is not the 
subject of the data itself or its quality, 
but because it was used in a historically important data visualization.

The timeline shows the names and lines indicating lifespan.
The individuals were grouped into five categories, which are called "divisions"
in the work.

1. Statesmen and Warriors
2. Divines and Physicians
3. Historians, Antiquarians, and Lawyers
4. Poets and Artists
5. Orators and Critics

The *Chart* was accompanied by a *A Description of a Chart of Biography: With a Catalogue of all the Names Inserted in It, and the Dates annexed to Them.*.
This included an index of the names, birth date, death date, age, and primary occupation of the individuals included in the *Chart*.

## A Specimen of a Chart of History

The *Description of a Chart of History* contained a chart called *A Specimen of a Chart of History*,
shown the following image.
The "Specimen" was a sample of the full chart. It only contained `r nrow(Specimen)` individuals,
divided into "Men of Learning" and "Statesmen".

The data frame `priestley::Specimen` contains the data necessary to reproduce this chart.
The dates used in `Specimen` and `Biographies` were taken from the index, and not directly 
from the chart. These charts indicated uncertainty in birth and death dates by using solid 
lines for certain segments, and using dots for uncertain segments, where the exact date
of birth or death was not known exactly.
In the `Specimen` data frame, the values of `start_1` and `end_1` represent the certain segment,
and `start_2` and `end_2` represent the uncertain segment.

```{r specimen-chart,message = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")

ggplot(priestley::Specimen) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = row, yend = row, x = start_2, xend = end_2),
               alpha = 0.5, size = 0.5) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = row, yend = row, x = start_1, xend = end_1),
               size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = (start_2 + end_2) * 0.5, y = row, label = name),
            size = 3, vjust = "bottom", nudge_y = 0.25, color = "gray50") +
  facet_wrap(~ division, ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("", 
                     minor_breaks = seq(-600, 0, 50),
                     breaks = seq(-600, 0, 100)) +
  scale_y_continuous("", expand = c(0.1, 0.1)) +
  ggtitle("A Specimen of the Chart of Biography") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = NA),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

## Full Chart

The full chart contains over 2,000 individuals and when printed was "about three feet in length,
and two feet in breadth".  The data frame `priestley::Biographies` contains data on the
individuals in the chart extracted from the name index.

```{r message=FALSE, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 7}
library("plotly")
library("dplyr")

start_year <- -1300
end_year <- 1800

bios <- priestley::Biographies %>%
  filter(in_1778) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(row = layout_segments(start_2, end_2, gap = 100, random = FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup()

  add_segments(x = ~ start_2, xend = ~end_2, y = ~ row, yend = ~row, data = bios,

         hovermode = "closest",
         legend = list(orientation = "h"),
         xaxis = list(
            title = "",
            autotick = FALSE,
            tick0 = (start_year %/% 100) * 100,

                showticklabels = FALSE,
                showgrid = FALSE
         )
        )
```


## Descriptions

The *Chart of Biography* displays the lifespans of individuals with line segments, using dots to indicate uncertainty about birth and death dates.
However, the name index from which this data is derived provides the birth and death dates of individuals in a variety of text descriptions, such as
"Euclid fl. 300 BC M", "Epaminondas d. 363 BC",  "Herodotus b. 484 BC d. af. 413 BC H", and "Suidas fl. ab. 11 Cent. Cr".
The name index uses a regular, concise representation of the birth and death dates of individuals, but they can appear in several formats: indicating on or more of the year(s) in which an individual was born, died, lived, or "flourished", as well as several ways of indicating uncertainty ("before", "after", "about", and only indicating the Century).
The *Description of a Chart of Biography* contains extensive discussion of how the lifespan segments were constructed from the available information. This section discusses how the segments in this data was generated.

Examples in which the date of death and the age at death are known. These are drawn with a single solid black line since there is no uncertainty.

-   Pindar d. 435 BC. 86 P
-   Sophocles d. 406 BC 91 P
-   Xenophon d. 359 BC. ab. 90 H
-   Plato d. 348 BC. 81 HP
-   Terence d. 159 BC. 35 P

> It is an imperfection which must necessarily attend every Chart of this
> nature, that the time of the death, but more especially the time of the birth
> of eminent men cannot always be found. In this case the compiler must content
> himself with placing his line as near as he can conjecture from history where
> his true place was, leaving marks to express the uncertainty
> there is attending it. The method I have used in
> this Chart is to express certainty by a full line, and
> what is uncertain by dots or a broken line, dispro
> of the dots in the following manner, according to the
> kind or degree of the uncertainty they have to express.
>
> If it be thought that a person was born or died but
> a little before or after a certain time, the full line
> begins or ends at the certain time, and a single dot only
> is placed at the beginning or end of the line

Examples include,

-   Herodotus b. 484 BC. d. af. 413 H

> If history informs us that he was born or died
> about a certain time, a dot is placed just under the
> beginning or end of the full line

Examples include,

-   Agis b. 24. BC. ab. 22
-   Thucydides d. ab. 391. ab. 80 H

> If the birth be certain but the death uncertain, the line begins full but ends in dots.

Examples include,

-   Abul Pharai b. 1226 l. af. 1285 H
-   Alain b. 1386 H

> If, as is often the case, the death be known but the birth
> unknown, the line begins with dots, and ends full

-   Epaminondas d. 363

> When it is faid that a writer flourished at or
> about a particular time, a short full line is drawn
> about two-thirds before and one third after that particular time,
> with three dots before and two after it; because, in
general, men are said to flourish much
> nearer the time of their death than the time of their
birth.

-   Euclid fl. 300 BC. M

What is left unspecified in the description is the mapping between dots and years?
None of the digital specimens of the Chart of Biography available are high resolution enough to make this out.
Dots seem a little less than decades?

> If it be uncertain even in what
> century a person lived or flourished, there is no full
> line made at all, but only dots or broken lines where
> I imagine it is most probable he might have flourished.

Priestley provides no other details about how long this line may be. However,
the examples on this [chart](http://www.enoughroomforspace.org/wp-content/uploads/cartographies-of-time_20130505_0006.jpg) have between six and seven dots, which seem
to correspond to 60--70 years.

-   Suidas fl. ab. 11 Cent. Cr                  
-   Hesychius fl. ab. 300 Cr

```{r example-ages}
examples <- c("Euclid fl. 300 BC M",
              "Epaminondas d. 363 BC",
              "Herodotus b. 484 BC d. af. 413 BC H",
              "Suidas fl. ab. 11 Cent. Cr",
              "Hesychius fl. ab. 300 Cr",
              "Agis d. 241 BC ab. 22",
              "Thucydides d. ab. 391 BC. ab. 80 H")
              
filter(Biographies, 
       text %in% examples) %>%
