## Introduction

Joseph Priestley's *A Chart of Biography* [@Priestley1864], first published in 1764, is the, or one of the, first instances of a modern timeline [@FriendleySigalHarnanasingh2013,@Friendly2006,@Friendly,@RosenbergGrafton2013,@wiki:chart-biography,@Davis2012].
The **priestley** is a data package containing datasets used in the the biographic information used in the 1st (1764) and 7th (1778) editions of the the *Chart of Biography*.

The timeline visualizes the lifespans of approximately two thousand individuals, 
described as "the most distinguished in the annals of fame"
(`r sum(Biographies$in_1778)` in the 1764 edition and `r sum(Biographies$in_1778)` in the 1778 edition).
The stated criteria for selection into this list was "fame" rather than "merit".

> My rule, I considered, was renown and not merit; acquired fame,
> and not deserved reputation: so that a person who had
> made a great noise in the world, though he were
> known by nothing but the devastation he had made
> in it, was more acceptable to me than one who had
> deserved ever so well of it, if he had passed through
> it without being much known.

The chart organized individuals into six divisions based on their primary occupations.

1. Statesmen and Warriors
2. Divines and Physicians
3. Historians, Antiquarians, and Lawyers
4. Poets and Artists
5. Orators and Critics

The data in this package come from the index of names  *Chart* was accompanied by a *A Description of a Chart of Biography: With a Catalogue of all the Names Inserted in It, and the Dates annexed to Them.*.
The data was extracted from the OCR'd versions of the 1764 and 1778 editions provided by Stephen Boyd Davis [@Davis2010].
This included an index of the names, birth date, death date, age, and primary occupation of the individuals included in the *Chart*.
The original index entries looked like this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
select(ungroup(Biographies), text) %>%
  head() %>%
  print()
```
These parsed and normalized to generate the data included in this package.

The package includes three data sets

-   `Biographies`: Names, occupations, birth dates, and death dates for all individuals in the *Chart of Biography*
-   `Kings`: Names and dates for the rules of major empires, used to annotate the axis of the *Chart of Biography*.
-   `Specimen`: Names, birth dates, and death dates for a subset of individuals included in the chart, a *Specimen of a Chart of Biography*.

## Replication of a Specimen of a Chart of History

*The Chart of Biography* was distributed with a pamphlet titled 
*A Description of a Chart of Biography*, which documented the methodology of the chart and included an index of the individuals included in the chart.
Since the full chart was 2 feet x 3 feet, the *Description* included a smaller chart titled *A Specimen of a Chart of Biography*.
The "Specimen" contained only `r nrow(Specimen)` individuals with lifespans between 800 BCE and 0, divided into only two categories: "Men of Learning", and "Statesmen".

The data frame `priestley::Specimen` contains the data necessary to reproduce this chart.
Priestley indicated uncertainty in lifespans using dots.
In our replication, the uncertain part of the lifespan is indicated using a thinner, gray line, while the certain section is indicated with a thicker, black line.
The `priestley::Specimen` data contains four variables that are used to draw 
the lifespans: `born_min`, `born_max`, `died_min`, and `died_max`.
The longer, uncertain line extends from the earliest birth date (`born_min`) to 
the latest death date (`died_max`), while the shorter certain line extends from the
latest birth date (`born_max`) to the earliest death date (`died_min`).
In some very uncertain cases, only `born_min` and `died_max` are available.

## Replication of the Full Chart

The full chart contains over 2,000 individuals.
The original physical form of this chart was "about three feet in length, and two feet in breadth".
The data frame `priestley::Biographies` contains data for all the the individuals in the chart extracted from the associated name index.
The following chart 


```{r message=FALSE, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 7,include=FALSE}

end_year <- 1800

breaks <- minor_breaks[!(minor_breaks %% 500)]

# Layout the segments
Biographies <- priestley::Biographies %>%
  group_by(division) %>%
  mutate(row = layout_segments(born_min, died_max, gap = 50))
