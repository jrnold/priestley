## Introduction

Joseph Priestley's *A Chart of Biography*, first published in 1764, is the first instance of a modern timeline.

The **priestley** package is a data-only package containing a few datasets with
the biographic information from the 1764 and 1778 editions of the the *Chart of Biography*.

```{r fig.height=2000, fig.width=3000, eval=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("plotly")
library("priestley")

xaxis <- list(title = "",
              tickmode = "array",
              tickvals = seq(-1200, 1800, by = 100),
              mirror = "all"
              )
xaxis$ticktext <- map_chr(xaxis$tickvals, ~ if_else(.x == 0, 
                                                    str_c("O CE"),
                                                    as.character(abs(.x))))

priestley_bios_1764 %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(y = runif(n = length(text)) + as.numeric(as.factor(division))) %>%
  plot_ly() %>%
  add_segments(y = ~ y, yend = ~ y, 
               x = ~ start_2, xend = ~ end_2,
               color = ~ division, text = ~ text, hoverinfo = "text") %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = xaxis,
    yaxis = list(title = "",
                 showticklabels = FALSE,
                 showgrid = FALSE),
    margin = list(b = 120)
  )


```

```{r eval=FALSE}
priestley_kings %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(.id = row_number()) %>%
  plot_ly(y = ~ .id, x = ~ year, 
          text = ~ name,
          hovertext = 
          mode = "marker+text")
```

A **ggplot2** example:
```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("priestley")

ggplot(priestley1764) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = name, yend = name, x = start_2, xend = end_2),
               alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = name, yend = name, x = start_1, xend = end_1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ division, ncol = 1) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(-1200, 1800, 10), 
                     breaks = seq(-1200, 1800, 100))
                     
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
yaml::yaml.load_file(here::here("data-raw/small-chart.yml")) %>%
  imap_dfr(~ tibble(division = .x, name = .y)) %>%
  left_join(priestley_bios_1764, by = "name") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(text))

```

## Descriptions

Examples in which the date of death and the age at death are known. These are drawn with a single solid black line since there is no uncertainty.

- Pindar d. 435 BC. 86 P
- Sophocles d. 406 BC 91 P
- Xenophon d. 359 BC. ab. 90 H
- Plato d. 348 BC. 81 HP
- Terence d. 159 BC. 35 P

> It is an imperfection which must necessarily attend every Chart of this 
> nature, that the time of the death, but more especially the time of the birth 
> of eminent men cannot always be found. In this case the compiler must content 
> himself with placing his line as near as he can conjecture from history where 
> his true place was, leaving marks to express the uncertainty
> there is attending it. The method I have used in
> this Chart is to express certainty by a full line, and
> what is uncertain by dots or a broken line, dispro 
> of the dots in the following manner, according to the
> kind or degree of the uncertainty they have to express.
> 
> If it be thought that a person was born or died but
> a little before or after a certain time, the full line
> begins or ends at the certain time, and a single dot only
> is placed at the beginning or end of the line

Examples include,

- Herodotus b. 484 BC. d. af. 413 H

> If history informs us that he was born or died
> about a certain time, a dot is placed just under the
> beginning or end of the full line

Examples include,

- Agis b. 24. BC. ab. 22
- Thucydides d. ab. 391. ab. 80 H

> If the birth be certain but the death uncertain, the line begins full but ends in dots.

Examples include,

- Abul Pharai b. 1226 l. af. 1285 H
- Alain b. 1386 H

> If, as is often the case, the death be known but the birth
> unknown, the line begins with dots, and ends full

- Epaminondas d. 363

> When it is faid that a writer flourijhed at or
> about a particular time, a short full line is drawn
> about two-thirds before and one third after that particular time,
> with three dots before and two after it; because, in
general, men are said to flourish much
> nearer the time of their death than the time of their
birth

- Euclid fl. 300 BC. M

What is left unspecified in the description is the mapping between dots and years?
None of the digital specimens of the Chart of Biography available are high resolution enough to make this out.
Dots seem a little less than decades?

> If it be uncertain even in what
> century a perfon lived or flourished, there is no full
> line made at all, but only dots or broken lines where
> I imagine it is most probable he might have flourished.

Priestley provides no other details about how long this line may be. However, 
the examples on this [chart](http://www.enoughroomforspace.org/wp-content/uploads/cartographies-of-time_20130505_0006.jpg) have between six and seven dots, which seem
to correspond to 60--70 years.
